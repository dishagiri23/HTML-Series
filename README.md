### DAY 1 :point_up:

Here’s a simple explanation of each line in your HTML boilerplate:

1. **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**  
   This tells the browser that the document is written in HTML5, which is the latest version of HTML. It's like saying, "Hey, this is an HTML document."

2. **`<html lang="en">`**  
   This starts the HTML document. The `lang="en"` tells the browser that the content is in English.

3. **`<head>`**  
   This is the "head" section of your HTML. It contains information about the webpage (not visible on the page itself), like the title and metadata.

4. **`<meta charset="UTF-8">`**  
   This tells the browser how to read the text on your webpage. `UTF-8` is a standard that supports most languages and special characters.

5. **`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`**  
   This makes your webpage look good on all devices, like phones, tablets, or computers. It adjusts the page's size to fit the device's screen.

6. **`<title>Document</title>`**  
   This sets the title of your webpage. The title appears on the browser tab or window. You can replace "Document" with the actual title you want.

7. **`<body>`**  
   This is where all the visible content of your webpage goes, like text, images, buttons, and more. 

8. **`</body>`**  
   This ends the body section.

9. **`</html>`**  
   This ends the HTML document. It tells the browser, "We’re done with the HTML."

### DAY 2

Here’s a simple explanation of the tags inside the `<body>` section:

1. `<h1>1st heading</h1>`  
   - This is a heading tag.
   - It creates a large and bold heading called "1st heading."
   - `h1` is the most important heading, and it is usually used for the main title of the page.

2. `<!--Heading tag is usually 6 types from h1 to h6-->`  
   - This is a **comment** in HTML.
   - Comments are notes for developers and do not appear on the webpage.

3. `<p>`  
   - This is a paragraph tag.
   - It is used to write text content in a block format.

4. `<br>`  
   - This is a line break tag.
   - It moves the text to a new line without starting a new paragraph.

5. `</p>`  
   - This is the closing tag for the paragraph.
   - It tells the browser the paragraph content is finished.
