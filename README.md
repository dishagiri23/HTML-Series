
##  HTML Series 

DAY 1

Here’s a simple explanation of each line in your HTML boilerplate:

1. **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**  
   This tells the browser that the document is written in HTML5, which is the latest version of HTML. It's like saying, "Hey, this is an HTML document."

2. **`<html lang="en">`**  
   This starts the HTML document. The `lang="en"` tells the browser that the content is in English.

3. **`<head>`**  
   This is the "head" section of your HTML. It contains information about the webpage (not visible on the page itself), like the title and metadata.

4. **`<meta charset="UTF-8">`**  
   This tells the browser how to read the text on your webpage. `UTF-8` is a standard that supports most languages and special characters.

5. **`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`**  
   This makes your webpage look good on all devices, like phones, tablets, or computers. It adjusts the page's size to fit the device's screen.

6. **`<title>Document</title>`**  
   This sets the title of your webpage. The title appears on the browser tab or window. You can replace "Document" with the actual title you want.

7. **`<body>`**  
   This is where all the visible content of your webpage goes, like text, images, buttons, and more. 

8. **`</body>`**  
   This ends the body section.

9. **`</html>`**  
   This ends the HTML document. It tells the browser, "We’re done with the HTML."
